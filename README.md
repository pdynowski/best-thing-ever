Best Thing Ever is a project designed to settle (or create) arguments amongst friends. It will deliver a pair of artists
(or albums, or songs) up for voting, and the user will objectively select which is better. Using an ELO rating system,
the app will track the wisdom of the crowd, as it were. It should be able to track the results separately for the population 
as a whole, and for any groups the user belongs to.
